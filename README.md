## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox & grid system
- Position system
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. Follow mobile first principle to finish responsive web design
2. Use vw as unit to define component size. Fix relative position between components when width changing and increase user experience
3. Combine html structure and z-index property to achieve background image & svg image layers relationship
4. Import svg file inside html structure and use filter: invert() & fill css property to achieve color modify effect when hover

### Continued development

1. Simplify redundant class and merge multiple CSS setting
2. Currently desktop mode background image width & height are both 100%, but target design should be width 90% and height 100%

### Useful resources
